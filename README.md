# React Native NavigationExperimental Sample App with Linting, Flow, ES6

You might be curious about [NavigationExperimental](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html#navigationexperimental)
as a replacement for the [Navigator](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html#navigator).
Why? The API is quite familiar if you are familiar with Redux.

A conversion of [react-native/Examples/UIExplorer/js/NavigationExperimental/NavigationCardStack-NavigationHeader-Tabs-example.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/js/NavigationExperimental/NavigationCardStack-NavigationHeader-Tabs-example.js)
with the following:

* [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/)

## Setup

* Install [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) per the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).
* `npm i` at the top level.

## Running flow

`npm run flow`

* *Critical* to use the right version of flow, which is specified in your package.json.

## Running the Linter

`npm run lint`

### To autofix issues:

`npm run eslint -- --fix`


## Starting React Native App

`react-native run-ios`
